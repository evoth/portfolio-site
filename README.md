# Portfolio Site
The home base of my programming portfolio, and a cohesive presentation of my resume and various projects.

## Current State
The design is getting along well; now I'm just adding the content.

## Todo
- See flutter.dev for ideas for a possible look for links
- Complete the resume section.
- Use tiles for skills chart instead of rows and columns
- Comment Bulma Sass (do this in FP too)
- Use templates instead of repetitive HTML
- Wait until both header and footer are loaded to reposition
