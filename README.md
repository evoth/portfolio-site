# Portfolio Site

## Plan

A clean, simple way to present my resume and projects, past and future.

## Current State

The design is getting along well; now I'm just adding the content.

## Updates since last commit

- Improvements to columns with images (image is cropped horizontally to fit)
- Updated Resume section
   - Added Skills section

## Todo

- See flutter.dev for ideas for a possible look for links
- Complete the resume section.
- Add a section for projects
   - Also, make some projects. I don't have many presentable projects yet, but this will be a good start.
- Add dark mode
