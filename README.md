# Portfolio Site
The home base of my programming portfolio, and a cohesive presentation of my resume and various projects.

## Website
See it in action at https://ethanvoth.com!

## Theme
For the sake of convenience, all of the standalone websites hosted under the ethanvoth.com domain use very similar theming. They all support light and dark mode, and theme preference is stored in a shared cookie between all of them (for now). The website is styled using [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), which is rendered (together with additional styling) from [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/).

## Todo
- Complete the resume section.
- Use tiles for skills chart instead of rows and columns
- Comment Bulma Sass (do this in FP too)
- Use templates instead of repetitive HTML
- Wait until both header and footer are loaded to reposition
- Fix margin/padding of skills chart
