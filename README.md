## Plan

A clean, simple way to present my resume and projects, past and future.

## Current State

The empty Bulma example HTML page.

## Updates since last commit

- This is the first (real) commit.

## Todo

- Create basic page using Bulma.
- Add a section for my resume.
   - Should include a link to download the PDF.
- Add a section for projects
   - Also, make some projects. I don't have many presentable projects yet, but this will be a good start.
